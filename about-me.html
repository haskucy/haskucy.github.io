        <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Bekasi and later moved to Cikarang, where I currently reside. I'm a flexible and easy-going person, comfortable adapting to different situations and working with people from various backgrounds. I enjoy understanding how things work, whether it's through technology, problem-solving, or exploring new ideas.</p>
            <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Indonesia. My work ranges from web development and machine learning to IT support and hardware repair, which I apply in my role as co-founder of Dr. Komputer. I enjoy tackling challenges, finding practical solutions, and learning something new along the way.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I'm curious about a lot of things—whether it's mathematics, technology, or simple everyday details most people overlook. I value honesty, effort, and keeping things straightforward, both in life and in work.</p>


        <h2>Interests and Aspirations</h2>
            <p>Beyond coding, I am fascinated by natural language processing, data visualization, and math proof verification programs like Lean 4. My curiosity extends to the theory of understanding knowledge, including epistemology, logic, and metacognition. I enjoy exploring how abstract concepts can be structured, analyzed, and applied in practical contexts.</p>
            <p>I have a strong interest in mathematics, particularly in problem-solving, combinatorics, and the foundations of logic, both classical and non-classical. I'm also drawn to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and how systems can be designed to process information efficiently.</p>
            <p>My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to technology and education, bridging the gap between abstract theories and real-world applications. I aspire to create tools and systems that not only solve problems but also help people think, learn, and explore ideas more effectively.</p>

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
            <p>Curiosity and a commitment to excellence drive my work. I am motivated by the desire to understand how things function, whether it's through solving complex problems, exploring new ideas, or improving existing systems. I approach challenges with a focus on practical solutions, blending technical knowledge with adaptable thinking.</p>
            <p>My interest in problem-solving goes beyond technical tasks—I enjoy dissecting abstract concepts, analyzing patterns, and finding connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. I value clarity, efficiency, and simplicity in both thought and execution.</p>
            <p>What keeps me going is the satisfaction of progress, the pursuit of knowledge, and the ability to create something that has real, tangible impact. Whether it’s a small fix or a large project, I find purpose in the process of making things work better.</p>
