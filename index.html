        <h2>Section Title</h2>
        <p>Paragraph text with <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b> styles. Math example: $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.</p>
        <p>I do not wish to pretend expertise in any of these fields, but rather to suspend my ignorance and try to find some connections between them in the meantime. I am writing this as an exploration, and I welcome and expect corrections on my explanations and speculations. However, I also welcome those who shy away from a paper as soon as mathematics makes its first appearanceâ€“my job is just to share my excitement about math and its connection with living things. I will begin by explaining fairly simple concepts, partially to keep the larger subject from slipping out from beneath me, but also to establish a method of building an understanding of the more complicated topics. Some of these topics are modeled after nature, elegant explanations of natural phenomena. Others are abstract: the math was put first and allowed to think freely.</p>
